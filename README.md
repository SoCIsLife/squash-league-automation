Managing squash (or any other) league can be quite tedious, e.g. determining groups, tracking scores, aggregating statistics, etc. This repo strives to solve these challenges. Currently, the codebase is just a proof-of-concept algorithm for determining groups for the next period given: (a) group configuration, (b) results of the previous period and (c) list of applicants.

Future effort probably should be focused on:
- developing a proper architecture
- integrating databases
- automating scoresheet generation
- deploying server/client applications
- developing user GUI
